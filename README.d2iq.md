# D2iQ fork of Troubleshoot

This is a fork of upstream project https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot
that allows faster iteration and customizations for diagnostics data collection
project - `dkp-diagnostics`.

Any patch provided to D2iQ fork should be proposed to the upstream project which
would eventually allow using upstream in the `dkp-diagnostics` project.

The fork is based on the upstream tag `v0.13.10` (latest version at the time of
forking the project).
